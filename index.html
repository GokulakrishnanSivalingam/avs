    <h1>AUNTY VERIYAN SANJEEV</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">“Not a flirt… just devoted to divine aunties.”</p>

    <ul>
          <li>Keeps roses in his bike basket — only for the 40+ queens 🌹</li>
      <li>Won’t reply to girls under 30 — “Too childish.”</li>
     <li>Once ironed her saree… while it was still on her 😳🔥</li>
  <li>Calls her "amma" in public… but whispers “baby” in his dreams 😈</li>
  <li>He didn’t choose the aunty life. The aunty life sat next to him in a saree.</li>
  <li>On her birthday, he made kolam with his own hair 🕯️</li>
  <li>Downloaded Bhajan ringtones… just to imagine her calling</li>
  <li>Hides under her window just to hear her drying her hair 💦</li>
  <li>Her cooking video had 14 views. All 14 were him. On repeat. At 2am.</li>
  <li>Says “Good morning, aunty” with respect… but zooms into her WhatsApp DP at night 😵‍💫</li>
  <li>Did 108 sit-ups after she said "you’ve put on weight kanna"</li>
  <li>Once touched the steel tumbler she drank from. Now it’s in a velvet box. 🙏</li>
  <li>Saw her wiping sweat… wrote a haiku about it 🌡️</li>
  <li>His search history: “Can you fall in love with a married woman respectfully?”</li>
  <li>Knows every crease in her pallu like it’s the map to salvation</li>
  <li>Felt jealous of her pressure cooker because she touched it longer 😭</li>
  <li>Her scolding gave him chest pain. And also... butterflies.</li>
  <li>Prayed to the same god she prays to — not for moksha, but for **mokka** (coffee with her)</li>
  <li>His ultimate fantasy? Drinking Boost while she feeds him banana chips 😩💗</li>

    </ul>

    <div class="footer">“He doesn't need love. He needs her... in a cotton saree. He's respectful, respectful to aunties only.”</div>
